- Edit the sample_playbooks/container/install_receptor.yml playbook and update the Ansible Tower information
- The attached Dockerfile uses private images so you have to login using docker login
- As part of the docker build you have to pass in the user and password for registering your container with Red Hat Subscription Manager
- After the installation is configured the receptor would be running in the container.
- When running the container we mount the local directory into the container, with the -v option, the path needs to be fully qualified.
- When doing the docker build you can pass RHSM_URL to point to a QA/CI subscription manager
